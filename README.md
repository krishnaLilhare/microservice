Mircroservice  :-  

microservice is a good way to solve a problem for big project idea ... 
like if our project is big and there is more and large diffrent diffrent number of module 
then we can create a diifrant diffrant module in seprate part 
and after that we can comunacate with all module using client part
so this way is caled is microservice. 

example :- 
 In this repo we create three microsrvice (user,hotel,rating) and we comunicate of this all three with each other. 
 so user microservice is comunicate with rating microservice and hotel microservice for featch a hotel details and rating of that hotel .
